# D3-challenge

In this project, I deliver a scatter chart analyzing each American State.  Each state compared percent of the population below the poverty line vs percent of the population that is without healthcare coverage. I used HTML, D3, Bootstrap, CSS, and Leaflet.  I added a tooltips cursor hover text to each scatter point data point with the data from each axes.
